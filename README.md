# WSH-JScriptExtensions
Extensions for Microsoft Windows Script Host JScript

This project contains several "include" files to add functionality to the WSH JScript environment to bring it up to speed with more modern versions of JavaScript.
This code has been tested on Windows 10 / WSH 5.812, which seems to be the same level of JScript in IE 8 (Javascript 1.5 / ECMAScript 3)

The major inspiration for this project is the JSON implementation by Douglas Crockford at [JSON.org](http://www.JSON.org) and I highly recommend also downloading
the most current version of that.

The "include.js" file shows how to "include" another .js file into your main script.
